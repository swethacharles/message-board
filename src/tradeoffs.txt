Trade-offs

- In memory data store vs db. Messages only persist while the app is running but in-memory store is faster to implement.
- Tests of the API. Did not have time.
- Sanitising user provided input to prevent for e.g. sql injections is using a db. Would be needed for a prod ready implementation.
